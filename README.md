# Threading Library

This project implements a simple user-level scheduler within a process with thread synchronization.

## Scheduler
Implement `pthread_create`, `pthread_exit`, `pthread_join`, and `pthread_self` interfaces. Threads are cycled in a [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling) fashion and the scheduler uses `SIGALRM` for timeouts.

## Synchronization features
1. Thread locking and unlocking, to prevent the scheduler from running at specific times.
2. An implementation of `pthread` barriers, to ensure one thread can wait for another thread to finish, and to collect a completed threadâ€™s exit status.
3. Support for mutexes in threads, which will enable mutual exclusion from critical regions of multithreaded code.

## Data Structures
```c
enum thread_status { TS_EXITED, TS_READY, TS_RUNNING, TS_BLOCKED };

typedef struct thread_control_block {
  pthread_t id;
  jmp_buf registers;
  void *stack;
  enum thread_status status;
  void *ret_val;
  bool has_mutex;
} TCB;

typedef struct {
  int flag;
} mutex_t;

typedef union {
  pthread_mutex_t mutex;
  mutex_t my_mutex;
} my_mutex_t;

typedef struct {
  int *waitlist;
  unsigned limit;
  unsigned count;
} barrier_t;

typedef union {
  pthread_barrier_t barrier;
  barrier_t my_barrier;
} my_barrier_t;
```

## Additions

### Helper functions
- `void scheduler_init()`: Initializes the scheduler by assigning the first thread as the main thread
- `void init_handler()`: Initializes the signal handler (schedule) for the timer
- `TCB *get_new_thread()`: Returns a new thread from the thread pool
- `void thread_init(TCB *new_thread)`: Allocates the stack for the new thread
- `void reg_init(TCB *new_thread, void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg)`: Initializes the registers for the new thread to run the start routine

### Test cases
- [test_one_thread.c](tests/test_one_thread.c): Tests the creation, execution, and cleanup of a single thread
- [test_custom_schedule.c](tests/test_custom_schedule.c): Tests the scheduling of a few threads
- [test_early_exit.c](tests/test_early_exit.c): Tests the handling of main thread exiting early
- [test_many_threads.c](tests/test_many_threads.c): Tests the handling of the maximum allowed number of threads
- [test_random_threads.c](tests/test_random_threads.c): Tests the handling of a few threads counting up to a random number
- [test_new_threads.c](tests/test_new_threads.c): Tests the cleanup of old threads and the creation of new threads
- [test_zombie_threads.c](tests/test_zombie_threads.c): Tests the handling of zombie threads (threads that have exited but have not been joined)
- [test_wait_thread.c](tests/test_wait_thread.c): Tests waiting for one busy thread to finish
